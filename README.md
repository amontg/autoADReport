# autoADReport
 Author & Owner: Amir Montgomery
 Created: 3/7/2022
 Objective: This package will take two .csv files and create a slice filled with differences between the two.
 [Why?] Every month, I have to audit my company's list of user machines. It is a repetitive, basic data analysis task. This solution automates that task.
 [In Progress] 
 
 - Compare parsed .csv files
 - Output something to show the differences between files
