 Objective: This package will take two .csv files and create a slice filled with differences between the two.
 
 [Why?] 
 
 Every month, I have to audit my company's list of user machines. It is a repetitive, basic data analysis task. This solution automates that task and gives the rows (which are names) that are different in the new file.
 
 [Deliverable]
